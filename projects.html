                <h2>First Website Created</h2>
                <p>This was done as the final project for my first website design class.</p>
                <p>Now this might not be my best work, but I wanted to give a visual of how far I have come as a student and web designer. This is the first website I ever created and as it does not look the prettiest, it has a lot of essential features you would want in a website.</p>
